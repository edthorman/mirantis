# Terraform with Mirantis Launchpad examples

We've prepared couple working examples for using Terraform with Mirantis Launchpad

* [AWS](aws/README.md), a complete infrastructure setup with VPC, LB, security groups etc.
* [Hetzner](hetzner/README.md), a simple example with just a couple of VMs provisioned for a UCP cluster.
* [VMware](vmware/README.md), a simple example with existing vSphere network.

**Please note:** The Terraform scripts listed above are provided as best practice. If your environment will require tweaks, feel free to adjust accordingly.
