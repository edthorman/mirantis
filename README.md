# Mirantis Launchpad

> NOTE: Mirantis Launchpad is currently BETA.

Mirantis Launchpad CLI tool ("**launchpad**") simplifies and automates deploying [Docker Enterprise](https://www.mirantis.com/software/docker/docker-enterprise/) on public clouds (like AWS or Azure), private clouds (like OpenStack or VMware), virtualization platforms (like VirtualBox, VMware Workstation, Parallels, etc.), or bare metal. Pretty much anywhere!

Launchpad can also provide full cluster lifecycle management. Multi-manager, high availability clusters (with sufficient spare node capacity to move active workloads around while updating) can even be upgraded with zero downtime.
