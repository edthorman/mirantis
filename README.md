# Mirantis Launchpad

Mirantis Launchpad CLI tool ("**launchpad**") simplifies and automates deploying [Docker Enterprise](https://www.mirantis.com/software/docker/docker-enterprise/) on public clouds (like AWS or Azure), private clouds (like OpenStack or VMware), virtualization platforms (like VirtualBox, VMware Workstation, Parallels, etc.), or bare metal.

Launchpad can also provide full cluster lifecycle management. Multi-manager, high availability clusters, defined as having sufficient node capacity to move active workloads around while updating, can be upgraded with no downtime.
